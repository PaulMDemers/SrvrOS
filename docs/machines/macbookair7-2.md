# MacBookAir7,2 / A1466

Updated: 2026-10-19. State: **active reference machine; partial device acceptance**.

## Identity and ownership

Development host: Ubuntu on the 13-inch Air, Broadwell-U, Intel HD Graphics 6000
`8086:1626`, xHCI `8086:9cb1`, Apple topcase `05ac:0291`, HDA `8086:9ca0` /
CS4208 `1013:4208` subsystem `106b:7e00`. Firmware, descriptors and routing evidence
are in the linked device guides. The shared integration baseline is now `main`,
including the completed `codex/linux-development-baseline` work. Subsequent
device work uses separate branches based on `main`.

## Accepted scope and open items

| Capability | State | Evidence / limit |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Desktop boot, rendering, keyboard, trackpad, USB documents | Physically exercised | User rounds and durable workspace history in the development journal |
| Held-click second-finger steering | User accepted | `d61e60a82a295d84`; counters do not independently prove every handoff |
| Brightness and audible volume adjustment | User accepted | `b427b78f21644bd2`; requested brightness 16/83 applied, three tone tests completed |
| Temperature and fan sampling | Live output confirmed | Fresh screenshot readings 83 C / 1202 RPM; logs reached 85 C, no SMC errors; calibration/power behavior not accepted |
| Two-finger physical right-click | Implemented; physical acceptance pending | Press role latches from initial contact count; one-finger press plus later steering finger remains primary |
| Context menu from trackpad taps | Physical acceptance open | Exit counts 5 primary and 1 secondary tap; user reported no visible right-click result |
| System window stability | No recurrence in latest physical round | `fed370ffbe33d554`: System and Help exited cleanly, no collector attention flags; earlier timeout cause remains unproven |
| PCM files / headphones | VM-tested / physical confirmation incomplete | Volume report does not separately accept these routes/workflows |
| Battery/AC and suspend/resume | Not implemented as live services | ACPI/EC foundations exist; runtime ownership and tests remain |
| Optional isolated AML probe | Native completion accepted | `4e5f438c4069752b`; resource queries, zero errors/denials/leaks; v22 still omits this diagnostic |
| USB Ethernet | Implemented CDC ECM, VM-tested | No actual adapter accepted |

## Latest interactive physical record

Release `fed370ffbe33d554`, v22, source `c6e50ec` (same tree as merged baseline
`e2d172b`), was exercised on October 19. The user reported generally good
behavior, with a new Terminal backspace display defect. Session
`session-00065e37230cc95f-00` has four verified logs, a clean desktop process exit
and no collector attention flags. Two saved screenshots are retained locally in
`build/native-desktop-trials/fed370ffbe33d554/physical-after/`.

System and Help remained present in the screenshots and exited without failure.
PCM playback completed 1,152,000 bytes with zero reported underruns; the user did
not separately confirm channel separation or headphones. The Sensors screenshot
shows 67 C core/package and 1,209 RPM with fresh sample ages. The offline exFAT
check was clean (163 directories, 818 files). General success does not establish
every gesture case: the final two-finger tap counter was zero, so specific
secondary-tap acceptance stays open.

Current installed is `fed370ffbe33d554`; previous remains accepted recovery
`b427b78f21644bd2`. The one-shot boot selection was consumed and no next boot is
armed. The Terminal screenshot's stray slash was reproduced in the host editor
and actual desktop VM: erasing padding left the output cursor beyond the edited
line. The source correction restores that cursor; it is not yet installed or
physically accepted. See the [journal](../desktop-progress-2026-10-19.md).

## Earlier interactive physical record

Release `b427b78f21644bd2`, v22, built from source `5b1ed05`.
Session `session-00065e281812e807-00` has saved logs and clean desktop exit.
Local evidence is in `build/native-desktop-trials/b427b78f21644bd2/physical-after/`.
The detailed [journal](../desktop-progress-2026-10-18.md) preserves failures,
partial acceptance and the previous implementation sequence.

At this checkpoint current is `b427b78f21644bd2`, previous is `f05dfcc01c28dc85`,
and the independent held-drag backup is under
`~/.local/share/srvros/known-good/d61e60a82a295d84`. Re-read actual installed state
before any action; these are historical identifiers, not values for other Macs.
The local trial record marks this run returned/reviewed, not armed for reboot.

## Next actions

Current shared-code work is on `device/macbookair7-2/reliability-input-power`
from `main` at `3b0b43a`: physical click latching, compositor delivery deadlines,
idle/sleep scheduling and console polling. The [October 19 journal](../desktop-progress-2026-10-19.md)
records host/VM evidence. Native automated batch `54a944ae1f7849ac`
(source `686edd8`) passed all five filesystem/shell rounds with retained files
verified and a clean offline exFAT check. The following bounded console-idle capture `1fe693c9889f131f`
(source `b3f0e31`) saved 60 seconds of samples: 94.55% idle, package 80→75 C,
1,206 RPM final fan, no SMC errors. It returned automatically with a clean
offline exFAT check. Subsequent isolated AML capture `4e5f438c4069752b` (source `17c6ed3`)
completed cleanly in 5.13 seconds and returned with clean exFAT. Unattended
desktop capture `06c646455f08555e` (source `e6fd681`) subsequently measured
60 seconds with Text open: 94.15% CPU0 idle samples, one frame presentation and
76,384 framebuffer bytes during the measurement. All four logs and the 1440×900
BMP were verified, with clean automatic return and offline exFAT. At that earlier checkpoint the current boot
payload was the desktop-idle diagnostic, with accepted desktop
`b427b78f21644bd2` retained as previous. The newer interactive record above
supersedes that installed-state snapshot; power consumption still needs
physical acceptance. Timer samples measure CPU0 scheduler occupancy, not energy.
The generalized Linux collector completed with zero partial reads on this host.
Additional IRQ, semaphore and deferred-worker foundations now pass host/VM tests.
A separate full-uACPI Q35 kernel passes real SCI, contended AML mutex/sleep and
teardown tests, including worker-owned EC disconnect I/O and halting with
state retained on a poisoned controller or a disconnect deadline. It is not the
installed payload or a native EC/battery provider. Its immutable `6b7c2bc8`
artifact passed a verified 30-minute, 37-round runtime/EC soak. Later explicit
synthetic namespace initialization checks worker ownership and refuses readiness
when firmware methods log denied accesses even if the API returns success.

1. Physically accept two-finger secondary click while preserving established primary drag; host/transport tests precede this check.
2. Follow up the System timeout after the delivery fix; the native cause is not yet proven.
3. Extend the accepted console and unattended desktop idle measurements to interactive activity and actual power/frequency evidence, retaining USB/input responsiveness.
4. Battery/AC runtime, headphone route acceptance and actual USB networking.
5. Shared inventory/profile/scaling work for the other model agents, coordinated
   through the [expansion plan](../apple-hardware-expansion-plan.md).

Shared desktop preparation now includes explicit integer 2× scaling. UEFI VM
checks passed at 2880×1800/2× and the Air's 1440×900/1×, including exact capture
pixels and input/window geometry. The installed Air capture exercised the default 1× path; the additional Pro
models still require their own framebuffer and input acceptance.


Read-only [package-energy and CPU0 active-frequency telemetry](../power-telemetry.md)
now has host arithmetic/service tests and VM refusal evidence. It remains opt-in
and physically unaccepted. The Linux MSR capture confirms register availability
on this host but is not an SrvrOS power result. No CPU power controls have changed.

Trackpad transport/palm faults now cancel a held interaction rather than deliver
an ordinary release. The compositor also preserves queued typing on pointer
cancellation. Host fault tests cover both paths; native acceptance is pending,
and this is not claimed as the cause of earlier unexplained window closures.

The generalized Linux inventory now includes `cpu-policy.json`. The October 19
capture had no partial reads: four online logical CPUs, `intel_idle`/`menu`, and
four `intel_cpufreq`/`schedutil` policies with 500–3,200 MHz limits. CPU0 listed
POLL through C10 as enabled. These are Linux policy observations, not SrvrOS
energy or deeper-idle acceptance. The [power guide](../power-telemetry.md)
documents units, non-atomic capture and missing-field semantics.
