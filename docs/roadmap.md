# Roadmap

Updated October 24, 2026. The goal is a pleasant native desktop on the MacBook
Air, with a solid shell and server foundation. The [current status](status.md)
and [machine records](machines/README.md) separate implementation from physical
acceptance. The [device parity ledger](device-parity.md) compares the Air with
ongoing Pro work.

## 1. Integrate the everyday laptop session

**Completed on Air7,2 release `9aa8dbf6fbda8252`.** Ordinary Home battery,
brightness, PCM audio and read-only sensors coexist with input and saved files.
The attended save/exit/reopen trial and local host/VM regressions pass; files,
resource retirement and Ubuntu recovery were verified. Cached low-charge notices
and battery-label access to System are implemented, with synthetic warning tests.
The combined profile preserves native gates and omits the isolated AML probe.

Subsequent v58/follow-up trials accept matched Ethernet/cable recovery, prompted
headphone controls and named gesture checks; PR88 tap settling is tester-accepted
with incomplete final diagnostic receipt. Physical low-charge/calibration remains
outside this acceptance. The accepted payload/evidence and older
recovery are retained independently of build cleanup.

## 2. Close remaining device and input acceptance gaps

Retain targeted secondary-click/cancellation checks, PCM channel/headphone
listening and network cable recovery in the hardware checklist. Reuse the Pro's
merged exact-adapter Ethernet support. Its draft USB Wi-Fi firmware/MCU work is
owned there; scanning and connectivity remain unfinished. Do not duplicate it or
copy its hardware acceptance to the Air. Each sibling needs captured identities.

**Done when:** the named provider has matched release/logs and explicit native
acceptance; skipped checks remain pending. No blanket fleet-wide parity claim.

## 3. Scale persistent workspaces

PR99 prevents silent diagnostic loss at the current node-table limits and adds
verified archival. PR102 implements bounded demand allocation, stable node
identities and paths, direct enumeration, memory reservation before mutation and
deleted-slot reuse. Host tests cover thousands of files, both exhausted budgets,
allocation failures and save/rename/delete/remount. The exact-stage VM passes
with 5000 preserved files, automatic return and desktop positive/refusal checks.
The native automated round passed beyond both old limits with all prior data
preserved and clean offline allocation; only the verified fixture was removed.
See the [capacity contract](filesystem-capacity.md).

**Completed:** bounded filesystem growth and safe refusal are host/VM validated
and accepted by the exact native persistence round. Path limits, linear lookup
and full metadata-sidecar rewrites remain explicit bounds.

## 4. Improve power from repeatable measurements

Compare matched workload, brightness, adapter state and duration using read-only
package-energy/active-frequency telemetry and scheduler occupancy. Linux policy
inventory is a comparison baseline. Evaluate polling/timer changes and deeper idle
separately. Relative charge display is not a calibrated runtime or health estimate.

**Done when:** repeatable measurements show improvement without input, storage,
audio or battery regressions. Temperature and idle percentage alone are not energy.

## 5. Make the desktop less constrained

The desktop replaces eager cache pairs with demand-allocated window
buffers under a 96 MiB compositor pixel budget. Client canvases also use current
sizes. Matched protocol v12 supports failed-resize refusal and restoration, and
coordinated budgets allow sixteen windows. Local host and VM tests pass for
allocation pressure, sixteen apps, a refused seventeenth launch, menus, exact
saved text, screenshots, resize and cleanup. Air7,2 accepts sixteen-window
opening, saved-file integrity and clean exit at `bf68e4e9b88b8ae7`; the round
contains no native cache totals or pressure injection.
See [window capacity](window-capacity.md).

Continue reusable controls, keyboard accessibility, app save/recovery and text
coverage. Native-density typography is separate from current 2x pixel scaling.

**Done when:** the native trial confirms workloads beyond eight windows,
resizing and close/reopen preserve documents and input. Host allocation-pressure
coverage and VM resource cleanup remain distinct from native interaction.

## 6. Suspend and expand hardware deliberately

Suspend/resume needs device quiescence, wake sources, firmware ownership and
reinitialization with preserved recovery; battery readout does not provide this.
Continue on-device Air6,1 and Pro11,2 development and independent bring-up of
Air7,1, Pro11,3 and Mini7,1 through the [Ubuntu workflow](ubuntu-device-agent-setup.md).
Internal installation, Bluetooth/camera, additional storage, process isolation and
POSIX/ports progress remain separate work as real applications require them.

No production-readiness or self-hosting date is promised. The
[October 18 roadmap](history/roadmap-2026-10-18.md) and
[original desktop plan](desktop-plan-2026-10-17.md) remain historical context.
